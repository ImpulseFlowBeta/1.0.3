## Terms of service

Impulse Flow's laucnher may occasionally download resources from Google servers. By
downloading or playing Impulse Flow, you agree to the Google Terms of Service:
https://policies.google.com/terms

For example, when installed from GitHub (as opposed to from a prepackaged
archive), Impulse Flow will download the Dart SDK from Google servers
immediately when first run, as it is used to execute the `laucnher` tool itself.
This will also occur when Impulse Flow is upgraded.

## About Impulse Flow

Our team has been developing on blockchain for a long time, so we decided to monetize our efforts and created our own p2e game project - Impulse Flow

We fully trust our fans and hope that they will trust us too, as we have put a lot of effort for you. We believe in maintaining a friendly and honest atmosphere in our community.

### Beautiful experiences

We want to give designers the ability to fully realise their creative vision without interfering with the creative process. The Impulse Flow engine gives you control over every pixel on the screen, and powerful compositing capabilities allow you to overlay and animate graphics, video, and text without limit. Impulse Flow includes full support for most modern formats that provide a pixel-perfect experience, whether creating a 3D object or animated image, as well as support for creating entirely new visual components.


### Gameplay 

Impulse Flow offers multiple and different game modes and features, so make sure to explore them all to enjoy the game at its fullest and be sure to take your piece of land!
Together, players can go on epic adventures, and share experiences and knowledge. They can choose to prove their worth and skill by defeating monsters, bosses, and other players. They can also choose to explore the world as peaceful foragers of goods and collectibles. What you do and when is entirely up to you! Each weapon type has its own associated skill and so do other RPG elements like crafting. Impulse Flow will feature challenging end-game PVE, hardcore PvP, a living economy, and much more!


### Extensible and open model

Impulse Flow works with any development tool (or none at all), and also includes
editor plug-ins for both __Visual Studio Code__ __Android Studio.__
Impulse Flow provides to speed your
development, regardless of your target platform. And accessing other native code
is easy, with support for both FFI.

Impulse Flow is a __fully open-source project__, and we welcome contributions.
